ml-ocr-tool
===========

Inspired by Machine Learning course on coursera.org.
A helper tool for generating ocr features for Machine Learning algos... 

More specifically, this tool gets a image with letters, and automatically export them into a matrix 
that can be imported into Octave to run some learning algorithm on.
Then this tool can read a Logistic Regression Model parameters, and run it on another image
to try and identify the letters.
